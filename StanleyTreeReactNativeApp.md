**Project:**

using the ReactNative framework, Create an app that resembels the current implementation of Stanley Tree. 

**Implement:**

1. Landing page with buttons that take you to a form to fill out. 
2. Auto Accident and Injury report forms.
   1. All fields with conditional logic will function in the same manner.
   2. All current required fields will be required and user will be inhibited from submitting the form in their absence. 
   3. All fields will have validation associated with them.
      1. Email speficic fields will perform basic email validation.
3. Submission of form returns you to landing page.
4. Submission of form executes a POST call to a "Backend" yet to be defined. 
5. Implement best practices (e.g. unit tests, standard design principles, documentation, code comments, etc.)

**Process:**

1. Outline and estimate steps to be taken.
2. Create git repository in the etg-AI-appdev space. 
3. Create a new ReactNative project 
4. Supply all necessary documentation (Readme.md, etc.)
5. Write code and commit progress daily to dev branch. 
6. Work will be broken down into weekly sprints with deliverables by EOD Friday.

**Evaluation:** 

The application will be set up so that it can be run on our (GregV/JonathanG) android devices using Expo Go over WiFi. Progress will be evaluated weekly and compared to sprint goals.
