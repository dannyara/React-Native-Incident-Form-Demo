    3. If step above doesn't work, then in Expo enter this URI to add the project:

## Common Issues and bugs

A common issue is the device disconnecting from the server, the device running expo may get this message pop up

- This happens when there has been a disruption in the server's live connection to the device, most common when running a tunnel connection
    - If this connection is interrupted, the user won't see live updates.
    - To resolve this: restart expo on the device and let expo redownload the app bundles
    - To prevent this: Until the app is deployed, it is best to test and run with a device that's on the same network as the server
